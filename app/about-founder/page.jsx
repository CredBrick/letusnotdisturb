              <p className='text-md font-normal md:text-lg leading-relaxed text-justify px-4'>When you do something in life, don't just do it for yourself. Let others learn from your experiences and experience the joy of inspiring others. This is the idea behind all the activities that Prashant Priyadarshi takes up in his life. The boy from Sahibganj in Jharkhand did not let his small town limit his big dreams. Prashant very proudly speaks of the two good things about his hometown, - it is located between the river Ganges on one side and mountains on the other with the most pleasant weather and St Xavier's school run by the Jesuit Missionary Society of India.
                It was the best school in a town with a large percentage of students coming from different parts of the world, and living in the hostel and a comparatively smaller group of students who enrolled as day scholars.</p>
                <br />
              <p className='text-md font-normal md:text-lg leading-relaxed text-justify px-4'>While things in his town went on like this, Prashant and his family at times have dealt with difficult situations on the economic front. His father was running a control shop and found it hard to meet all comforts as a control shop owner and a part-time astrologer. Despite his economic limitations, he wanted to ensure the best education for his children. Knowing the situation at home, Prashant's elder brother started supporting their father by giving tuition for children younger to him. Soon his brother moved to Delhi to study at Delhi University and later went on to secure a job in an MNC in that city.
                His brother's job gave them the luxury of buying a color television and Prashant's dreams were further fueled by the fantasy shown on the silver screen. He says Amir Khan's Taare Zameen Par and 3 Idiots left a lasting positive impact on him.</p>
